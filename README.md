# WhirlClone
Clone of popular online forum Whirlpool

This is not intended for real use (at this stage), and I will not be making any money off this website whatsoever. I am simply using it as an educational tool to understand how a forum is designed, and the key concepts I need to understand to one day create my own original product.

My plan is to initially get this website to look and act like Whirlpool in the quickest way possible and then fine tune it and optimise it. It will have many bugs and should not be used in any capacity in the real world, as I will initially be doing crazy things like storing passwords in plain text just to speed up development. I will be doing things like that which are obviously incorrect but I believe the best way for me to approach this project is to get something done and then work backwards from there and clean the whole thing up.
